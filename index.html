<h2>My Beachbody Sonet</h2>
<p>I sat on my couch looking at my toes <br />
Trying to decide which wings I wanted<br />
Sweet barbecue or spicy buffalo <br />
Popping mint antacids while I grunted </p>

<p>Then on my tv like hocus pocus<br />
Appeared Sean T with a message for me<br />
It's only 25 minutes - <span class="boldTitle">focus!</span><br />
You can change your life through <span class="boldTitle">insanity</span></p>

<p>I put aside my thoughts of the wing feast<br />
I should jump on board with <span class="boldTitle">Sean and Tony</span><br />
And with there help I will become a <span class="boldTitle">beast</span><br />
These dudes are legit, not at all phony</p>
